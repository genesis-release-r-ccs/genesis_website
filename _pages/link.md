[CHARMM-GUI](https://www.charmm-gui.org) is a web-based modeling support tool
developed by the [Im group](https://compbio.lehigh.edu) at Lehigh
University that automatically generates input files including initial structure
of MD simulations for various MD software. GENESIS input files for not only MD
simulations but also FEP calculations can be generated by CHARMM-GUI. 

##  CafeMol

[CafeMol](https://www.cafemol.org) is the MD simulation software for
coarse-grained models developed by the [Takada
group](http://theory.biophys.kyoto-u.ac.jp/index-en) at Kyoto University.
They have developed a variety of coarse-grained models, and we have introduced
some of them into GENESIS.

## QSimulate

[QSimulate-QM](https://qsimulate.com/academic) software developed by Quantum
Simulation Technologies, Inc. is integrated with GENESIS (after ver. 1.6.1) to
run QM/MM calculations. The software is highly parallelized and achieves
high-throughput QM/MM-MD simulations at various levels of QM, DFTB3, DFT, MP2,
etc. GENESIS/QSimulate-QM opens a broadened scope of applicability for QM/MM
calculations. The use of the software has been demonstrated in a publication,
[J. Phys. Chem. B 125, 4701
(2021)](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c01862).
