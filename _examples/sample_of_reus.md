REUS simulation can be done by just adding the `[REMD]` section in the control
file of the conventional MD simulation with restraints and modifying the
`[INPUT]`/`[OUTPUT]` sections. The following sample is a REUS simulation using
distance restraints with 6 replicas. During the simulation, force constants and
target distance values are exchanged between replicas. Note that the parameter
rest_function in the `[REMD]` section points out the index of restraint function
defined in the `[RESTRAINTS]` section.

[BOUNDARY]
type             = PBC              # periodic boundary condition

[SELECTION]
group1           = an:N and resno: 1         # select atom i
group2           = an:O and resno: 10        # select atom j

[RESTRAINTS]
nfunctions       = 1
function1        = DIST                      # use distance restraint
select_index1    = 1 2                       # restrained atom index i and j
constant1        =  10  10  10  10  10  10   # force constant of each replica
reference1       = 4.0 4.3 4.5 4.7 4.9 5.1   # target distance of each replica
```

In this case, we define parameter1 = (10, 4.0), parameter2 = (10, 4.3), â€¦, and
parameter6 = (10, 5.1), and each replica has one of these parameters.
