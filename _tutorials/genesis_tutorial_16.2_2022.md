# Multi-scale cryo-EM flexible fitting

MD-based flexible fitting to the cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM)
density map at a resolution close to 5 &#8491; is challenging, when a protein
domain has to undergo a sophisticated conformational change, such as
domain rotation. The protocol[^1] presented here 
involves a few steps, that significantly increase the chances for the
correct fitting in such difficult cases. It employs the replica-exchange
flexible fitting to obtain a correct protein movement/rotation.[^2] To
speed up the calculations, the coarse-grained Go-model developed by
Karanicolas and Brooks (KB Go-model) [^3]<sup>,</sup> [^4] is used at this step. Then,
to map the coarse-grained model to the full-atom model, the targeted MD
method is used. Finally, the obtained structure is refined with the
all-atom MD flexible fitting.[^5] 

Before going through this tutorial, it is advised to complete the basic
tutorials concerning the basic MD-based flexible fitting protocol
([Tutorial 16.1](/tutorials/genesis_tutorial_16.1_2022/)), 
the MD simulations using the GB/SA model ([Tutorial 8.1](/tutorials/genesis_tutorial_8.1_2022/)), 
the coarse-grained MD simulations using the KB Go-model ([Tutorial 7.1](/tutorials/genesis_tutorial_7.1_2022/)) 
and the replica-exchange MD (REMD) simulations ([Tutorial 12.1](/tutorials/genesis_tutorial_12.1_2022/)).

## 0. Preparation 

All the files required for this tutorial are hosted in the 
[GENESIS tutorials repository on GitHub](https://github.com/genesis-release-r-ccs/genesis_tutorial_materials).
If you haven't downloaded the files yet, open your terminal and 
run the follwing command (see more in [Tutorial 1.1](/tutorials/genesis_tutorial_1.1_2022/))

As described in [Tutorial 16.1](/tutorials/genesis_tutorial_16.1_2022/),
installing the [SITUS program package](http://situs.biomachina.org/) and
making a symbolic link to the CHARMM toppar directory is necessary.

```bash
$ cd ~/GENESIS_Tutorials-2022

# if not yet
$ git clone https://github.com/genesis-release-r-ccs/genesis_tutorial_materials

$ cd tutorial-16.2
$ ln -s ../../Others/CHARMM/toppar ./
$ ls

##  1. Coarse-grained (CG) simulations

### 1.1. Preparing a simulated density map of the target state

In this tutorial, a small protein (adenylate kinase) in open state will
be fitted to a simulated density map in the closed state. First, the
density map for the coarse-grained simulations will be generated as the
target for the fitting, basing on the PDB: 1AKE. Downloading and
modifying the PDB file is necessary, so that the structure contains only
protein chain A with non-hydrogen atoms:

```bash
# Download the PDB file of the closed state of adenylate kinase
$ cd 01_CG_emmap
$ wget https://files.rcsb.org/download/1AKE.pdb

# Generate a new PDB file that contains protein heavy atoms
$ vmd -dispdev text 1AKE.pdb
vmd > set sel [atomselect top "chain A and protein and not hydrogen and not altloc B"] 
vmd > $sel writepdb closed.pdb
vmd > exit
```

The synthetic density map is generated by the `emmap_generator` with the
provided INP file and should be visualized in VMD, as described in
[Tutorial 16.1](/tutorials/genesis_tutorial_16.1_2022/).

```bash
# Generate synthetic EM density map (CG_closed.sit)
$ /home/user/GENESIS/bin/emmap_generator INP > log
```

### 1.2. Building the initial structure

The structure of adenylate kinase in the open state should be downloaded
and modified in the same fashion as it was done with structure in the
closed state:

```bash
# Download PDB file of the open state of adenylate kinase
$ cd ../02_CG_build/
$ wget https://files.rcsb.org/download/4AKE.pdb
$ ls
4AKE.pdb

# Generate a new PDB file that contains protein heavy atoms
$ vmd -dispdev text 4AKE.pdb
vmd > set sel [atomselect top " chain A and protein and not hydrogen and not altloc B"] 
vmd > $sel writepdb open.pdb
vmd > exit
```

Now, it is possible to visualize the open.pdb in VMD, together with the
situs map `CG_closed.sit`. The structure of adenylate kinase in the open
state is shifted from the map, so the initial rigid body fitting step
with colores is necessary:

```bash
# Perform rigid-body fitting using SITUS
$ /home/user/Situs_3.1/bin/colores ../01_CG_emmap/CG_closed.sit open.pdb -res 5 -nprocs 4
```

This calculation results in 7 new `col_*.pdb` files with fitted
structures. For further calculations, we should choose the structure
with the highest cross-correlation coefficient (c.c.) between the fitted
structure and simulated densities:

```bash
# Check the c.c. value in the obtained PDB files
$ grep "Unnormalized correlation coefficient:" col_*.pdb
col_best_001.pdb:REMARK    Unnormalized correlation coefficient: 0.709285
col_best_002.pdb:REMARK    Unnormalized correlation coefficient: 0.614500
col_best_003.pdb:REMARK    Unnormalized correlation coefficient: 0.601603
col_best_004.pdb:REMARK    Unnormalized correlation coefficient: 0.590259
col_best_005.pdb:REMARK    Unnormalized correlation coefficient: 0.590186
col_best_006.pdb:REMARK    Unnormalized correlation coefficient: 0.580958
col_best_007.pdb:REMARK    Unnormalized correlation coefficient: 0.562662
```

As a result, `col_best_001.pdb` will be used as the initial structure to
generate the coarse-grained KB Go-model parameters. For this purpose, we
will use the MMTSB Web Service, as described in details in the [Tutorial 7.1](/tutorials/genesis_tutorial_7.1_2022/): Coarse-grained MD simulation with the KB
Go-model. First, we should prepare the `col_best_001.pdb` file for the
submission to the server:

```bash
# "clean" the file by deleting the entries other than ATOM
$ grep -e "^ATOM" col_best_001.pdb  > col_best_001_edited.pdb 
```

Next, we submit it to
the [MMTSB](http://www.mmtsb.org/webservices/gomodel.html) server, with
a reference tag (i.e. open). The tar-ball file is sent to your email
address. We unpack it in the working directory:

```bash
# extract the tar-ball file
$ tar -xvf open.tar
```

To build the Go-model for simulations, several modifications have to be
applied to the files from MMTSB, such as replacing the atom names.
Superimposing the coordinates of molecule in `GO_open.pdb` file on the
original coordinates submitted to the server can be done using the CA
atoms positions. Then it is possible to generate the `go.psf` and `go.pdb`
files for the CG simulation using VMD. For the details, please see
[Tutorial 7.1](/tutorials/genesis_tutorial_7.1_2022/). This is done with the provided
setup.tcl script:

```bash
### read pdb
mol load pdb GO_open.pdb
mol load pdb col_best_001_edited.pdb 

### calculate the shift matrix using the CA atoms positions
set base_shifted [atomselect 0 "name CA"] 
set base_original [atomselect 1 "name CA"] 
set matrix [measure fit $base_shifted $base_original] 

### move the  GO_open.pdb structure
set shifted_molecule [atomselect 0 "all"] 
$shifted_molecule move $matrix

### replace residue names with G1, G2, G3, ...
set residue_list [lsort -unique [$shifted_molecule get resid]] 
foreach i $residue_list {         set resname_go [format "G%d" $I]          set res [atomselect 0 "resid $i" frame all]          $res set resname $resname_go     }
$shifted_molecule writepdb tmp.pdb

### generate PSF and PDB files
package require psfgen
resetpsf
topology GO_open.top

segment PROT {      first none      last none      pdb tmp.pdb     }

regenerate angles dihedrals
coordpdb tmp.pdb PROT

# write psf and pdb files
writepsf go.psf
writepdb go.pdb

exit
```

The script can be run with VMD:


```bash
$vmd -dispdev text <setup.tcl | tee run.out
```

The structure should be visually inspected. The positions of coordinates
should coincide with the density map, so it is worth to open and see
also the `../01_CG_emmap/CG_closed.sit` in VMD:

```bash
$ vmd -situs ../01_CG_emmap/CG_closed.sit
vmd > mol load pdb go.pdb psf go.psf
```

### 1.3. Flexible fitting with replica-exchange scheme

When using the coarse-grained models, it is not necessary to run
minimization and equilibration. We can run the production step
immediately. For real applications, all the simulations shown in this
tutorial should have more time steps to achieve a better convergence.
The input file for the production run using 32 replicas is provided in
the next folder:

```bash
# Change directory to run the CG simulation
$ cd ../03_CG_REMD_fitting
$ ls
INP
```

Have a look at the parameters provided in the INP file, both for REMD
and flexible fitting parts:

```toml

```

The set of 32 force constants provided here was previously tested[^1] 
to ensure sufficient overlaps between the potential
energies of replicas and, as a result, the exchange ratios in the range
of 0.2 -- 0.3 for most of the studied protein systems. The exchange
period (100) was also previously tested and yielded better results for
tested proteins than exchange periods 10 or 1000. Note, that by
decreasing the exchange period to 0 you can automatically perform 32
independent fitting runs at different force constants.

Now, we are ready to execute mpirun using 64 CPU cores (the number of CPU cores should be a multiplication of the number of replicas). This
calculation may take a few hours and should be submitted as a batch job
on the cluster.

```bash
# Perform REMD flexible fitting
$ export OMP_NUM_THREADS=2
$ mpirun -np 32 /home/user/GENESIS/bin/atdyn INP > log
```

Many files are produced as a result of the
simulation: `md_*.dcd`, `md_*.rem`, `md_*.rst`, `log_*.log` for each
replica `*` and log. The `log_*.log` files contain information about time
course of the energy and c.c. of each replica.  After the fitting, it is
necessary to visualize at least one trajectory with VMD to ensure that
the structure is well fitted to the target density.

```bash
$ vmd -situs ../01_CG_emmap/CG_closed.sit
vmd > mol load pdb ../02_CG_build/go.pdb psf ../02_CG_build/go.psf
vmd > mol addfile md_1.dcd
```

### 1.4. Analysis of the fitting results

It is time to analyze the changes in c.c. during the simulation, saved
in the column 14: `RESTR_CVS001` in the `log_*.log` files. It can be done
simultaneously for all 32 replicas in a `for` loop with a simple bash
script, provided in the tutorial files. This script also shows which
replica have given the highest c.c. Have a look at the script:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

for REP in `seq 1 32`
    do
    grep 'INFO:' ../03_CG_REMD_fitting/log_${REP}.log | awk '{printf ("%10s\t%20s\n",$2,$15)}' | grep -v "RESTR"  > temp1
    awk -v var=log_${REP}.log '{print var,"\t",$0}' temp1 > cc-list$REP
    rm temp1
    highest_cc=$(awk '{print $3}' cc-list$REP | sort -n | tail -1)
    grep "$highest_cc" cc-list$REP  >> temp2
done

sort -rk3 temp2 > the-highest-cc.txt
rm temp2
```

We run the bash script in the following way:


```bash
# Change directory for analysis
$ cd ../04_CG_analysis

# Run the bash script
$ chmod +x analyze-cc.sh
$ ./analyze-cc.sh
```

The script generates a series of files `cc-list*` for each replica and a
single file `the-highest-cc.txt`. All files contain the log name in the
first column, time step in the second column, and c.c. in the last
column. 

### 1.5. Choosing the model with the highest cross-correlation coefficient

The file `the-highest-cc.txt` gathers the highest c.c. values from all
replicas and it is sorted according to the c.c. value in the last
column:

```
log_1.log                   634300                      0.9065
log_15.log                 223000                      0.9064
log_11.log                 623100                      0.9064
log_5.log                   248000                      0.9063
log_8.log                   316300                      0.9062
...
```

It is visible that the replica 1 reached the highest c.c. 0.9065 in the
time step 634300. Thus, we encourage the users to calculate the RMSD and
to generate a graph "Time courses of c.c. and Cα RMSD with respect to
the target structure" for replica 1 by yourself. This can be done in a
very similar way as it was described in [Tutorial 16.1](/tutorials/genesis_tutorial_16.1_2022/).

For the targeted MD simulation, the frame from the REMD simulation that
has the highest c.c. has to be extracted from the trajectory:

```bash
$ vmd -dispdev text
vmd > mol load pdb ../02_CG_build/go.pdb psf ../02_CG_build/go.psf
vmd > mol addfile ../03_CG_REMD_fitting/md_1.dcd
vmd > animate write pdb CG_open.pdb beg 63 end 63
vmd > exit
```

## 2. All atom (AA) simulations

### 2.1. Preparing a simulated density map of the target state

The simulated density map for the AA simulations is prepared in a
similar way as for CG simulations, but a smaller voxel size is used. The
synthetic density map is again generated with the `emmap_generator` and
should be visualized.

```bash
# Change directory
$ cd ../05_AA_emap

# Generate synthetic EM density map (AA_closed.sit)
$ /home/user/GENESIS/bin/emmap_generator INP > log
```

### 2.2. Building the initial structure

We use the best structure fitted with Situs
(`../02_CG_build/col_best_001.pdb`) as the initial coordinates for the
targeted MD simulation. Here, we use the CHARMM force field and the
initial pdb and psf files can be prepared with VMD as in [Tutorial 2.3](/tutorials/genesis_tutorial_2.3_2022/):

```bash
$ cd ../06_AA_build

$ vmd -dispdev text
vmd > package require psfgen
vmd > resetpsf
vmd > topology ../toppar/top_all36_prot.rtf
vmd > pdbalias residue HIS HSD
vmd > pdbalias atom ILE CD1 CD
vmd > segment PROA {pdb ../02_CG_build/col_best_001.pdb}
vmd > coordpdb ../02_CG_build/col_best_001.pdb  PROA
vmd > guesscoord
vmd > writepdb open.pdb
vmd > writepsf open.psf
vmd > exit
```

Now, it is time to prepare the target pdb file for the targeted MD
simulation. We will use the MD frame with the highest c.c. derived in
section 1.5. Choosing the model with the highest cross-correlation
coefficient. Unfortunately, this MD frame does not have any other atoms
than CA and the target pdb in GENESIS needs to have the same number of
atoms as the pdb file used in this simulation, even if we select only
the CA atoms as a target. Therefore, we copy the open.pdb file,
substitute the coordinates of the CA atoms with the coordinates from the
`CG_open.pdb` and save the new "fake" pdb file as `CG_open2.pdb`. The bash
script prepare-target.sh for this operation is given in the folder
`06_AA_build`.

```bash
# Run the bash script
$ chmod +x prepare-target.sh
$ ./prepare-target.sh
```

### 2.3. Energy minimization

Before the targeted MD simulation, the structure needs to undergo energy
minimization to remove steric clashes. The input file for this
calculation is provided.

```bash
# Perform energy minimization using 16 CPU cores
$ cd ../07_AA_minimize
$ export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4
$ mpirun -np 4 /home/user/GENESIS/bin/atdyn INP > log
```

### 2.4. Targeted MD towards the chosen model from CG simulations

Next, we perform the targeted MD in implicit solvent.

```bash
# Change directory to run targeted MD
$ cd ../08_AA_targeted_MD
```

The control file is given in the folder. For the targeted simulation,
the CA atoms are chosen:

```toml
[SELECTION]  
group1           = an:CA

[RESTRAINTS] 
nfunctions       =        1
function1        =     RMSD
constant1        =      500
reference1       =        0
select_index1    =        1

[FITTING] 
fitting_method   = TR+ROT
fitting_atom     = 1
mass_weight      = NO
```

Now it is necessary to extract the last frame from the targeted fitting.
Also, after the targeted MD, the structure might be still shifted a
little with respect to the positions of the CA atoms. This is why we
additionally superimpose the obtained structure on the CA positions
after REMD fitting in VMD with the provided setup.tcl script:

```bash
### save the last frame
mol load pdb ../06_AA_build/open.pdb psf ../06_AA_build/open.psf
mol addfile md.dcd
animate write pdb targeted_last.pdb beg last end last
mol delete all

### read pdb
mol load pdb targeted_last.pdb
mol load pdb ../06_AA_build/CG_open2.pdb

### calculate the shift matrix using the CA atoms positions
set base_shifted [atomselect 1 "name CA"] 
set base_original [atomselect 2 "name CA"] 
set matrix [measure fit $base_shifted $base_original] 

### move the  targeted_last.pdb structure
set shifted_molecule [atomselect 1 "all"] 
$shifted_molecule move $matrix
$shifted_molecule writepdb targeted_shifted.pdb

exit
```

Let's visualize the targeted MD trajectory with VMD. We need to check if
the CA atoms in `targeted_shifted.pdb` are well fitted to the CA positions
from the KB Go-model simulations and how big is the difference in CA
positions before and after the superimposing:

```bash
$ vmd -pdb ../06_AA_build/open.pdb ../06_AA_build/open.psf md.dcd
vmd > mol load pdb targeted_shifted.pdb
vmd > mol load pdb ../04_CG_analysis/CG_open.pdb
```

### 2.5. Refinement of the structure with flexible fitting

The last step of the multi-scale protocol involves the refinement of the
obtained fitted model with the MD flexible fitting using CHARMM force
field in implicit solvent. The control file is also provided in the
directory.

```bash
# Change directory to run the MD fitting
$ cd ../09_AA_refinement
```

The biasing potential set on the protein heavy atoms is very high,
because the protein is already fitted to the density and we want to
refine the positions of the side chains. See the part of the input file
responsible for the fitting:

```toml
[SELECTION] 
group1          = all and heavy

[RESTRAINTS] 
nfunctions      = 1
function1       = EM
constant1       = 20000
select_index1   = 1

[EXPERIMENTS] 
emfit           = YES
emfit_target    = ../05_AA_emmap/AA_closed.sit
emfit_sigma     = 2.5        # Sigma in simulated map definition
emfit_tolerance = 0.01       # Tolerance for simulated map calculation
emfit_period    = 1          # update of the force
```

The MD flexible fitting simulation can be executed with ATDYN using 16
CPU cores:

```bash
# Perform flexible fitting
$ export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4
$ mpirun -np 4 /home/user/GENESIS/bin/atdyn INP > log
```

The files `run.dcd`, `run.pdb`, `run.rst` and `log` are produced during the
simulation.

### 2.6. Analysis of the fitting results

The RMSD with respect to the target structure, the time course of c.c.
and MolProbity score can be easily analyzed for the MD flexible fitting
refinement trajectory. However, this was already described in details in
[Tutorial 16.1](/tutorials/genesis_tutorial_16.1_2022/) so the users are advised to do those analyses by
themselves.

```bash
# Change directory for analysis
$ cd ../10_AA_analysis
```

Here, we find the highest value of c.c. in the final simulation. The
following commands extract the time step (first column) and c.c. value
(second column) and sort according to the c.c. value:

```bash
# Find the highest c.c.
$ grep "INFO:" ../09_AA_refinement/log| awk '{print $2, $19}' | grep -v "RESTR" > cc.log

$ sort -rk 2 cc.log | head -5
39500 0.9840
47000 0.9837
46500 0.9837
34000 0.9837
48500 0.9836
```

The structure characterized with the highest c.c. is supposed to be the
best structure obtained in the fitting simulation. It is reached at the
39500 time step with the `crdout_period = 500`, so it will be the 79th
frame in the trajectory. Let's extract this structure from the
trajectory and compare it with the initial structure and the best
structures obtained in the CG REMD fitting and in targeted MD. We should
also visualize the trajectory in VMD to see how well the structure fits
the density:

```bash
# Find the best fitted structure after the MD refinement
$ vmd -situs ../05_AA_emmap/AA_closed.sit
vmd > mol load pdb ../06_AA_build/open.pdb psf ../06_AA_build/open.psf
vmd > mol addfile ../09_AA_refinement/md.dcd
vmd > animate write pdb final_best.pdb beg 79 end 79

# Load the initial structure after Situs fitting
vmd > mol load pdb ../02_CG_build/col_best_001.pdb

# Load the best fitted structure after REMD
vmd > mol load pdb ../04_CG_analysis/CG_open.pdb

# Load the best fitted structure after targeted MD
vmd > mol load pdb ../08_AA_targeted_MD/targeted_shifted.pdb

# Load the best fitted structure after MD refinement
vmd > mol load pdb final_best.pdb
```

The structures are compared in the figure below. The target map with the
initial structure after Situs fitting is in cyan, the best fitted
structure after REMD is shown as red spheres, the best fitted structure
after targeted MD is in green, the best fitted structure after MD
refinement is in orange together with the target structure, again in
cyan. The multi-scale protocol facilitated obtaining a structure very
close to the target one. Adenylate Kinase shows a relatively easy domain
movement and it was used in this tutorial due to its small size that
makes the calculations less time-consuming. However, the multi-scale
protocol is dedicated mainly for the protein systems with complex domain
movements, that are hard to capture using a one-step flexible fitting
simulation.
