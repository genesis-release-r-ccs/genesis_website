In this section, we illustrate a QM/MM MD simulation of alanine
tripeptide (Ala~3~) in solution using density functional tight binding
(DFTB). Let's download the tutorial file
([tutorial22-15.2b.tar.gz](assets/tutorial_files/2023_10_tutorial22-15.2b.tar.gz){.mtli_attachment
.mtli_zip}). This tutorial contains five directories.

``` wp-block-preformatted
$ unzip tutorial22-15.2b.zip 
$ cd tutorial-15.2 
$ ls  
1_dftb/   2_system/   3_qmmm/   4_analysis/   toppar/
```

Let's make a link to GENESIS,

``` wp-block-preformatted
$ ln -s ../../Programs/genesis-2.0/bin ./bin
```

#### [1. DFTB+]{#1_DFTB} {#dftb .wp-block-heading}

We will use [DFTB+](https://dftbplus.org/){rel="noreferrer noopener"
aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank"} in this tutorial.
The program is available free of charge from the website,
[dftbplus.org](https://dftbplus.org/){rel="noreferrer noopener"
aria-label="https://dftbplus.org/ (opens in a new tab)"
target="_blank"}. DFTB calculations require a set of parameters for each
atoms, which are stored in the so-called Slater-Koster (SK) files. The
files are available from
[dftb.org](https://dftb.org/){rel="noreferrer noopener"
aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank"}. Note that some
parameters are suitable for organic/bio molecules (3ob), whereas others
are developed for materials science (matsci). Also, the available
elements are different among the parameter sets. See the [download
page](https://dftb.org/parameters/download){rel="noreferrer noopener"
target="_blank"} for more details. Here, we will use the 3ob parameters
and carry out DFTB3 calculations for Ala~3~. We assume that you have
installed DFTB+ and downloaded the 3ob files in you computer.

`1_dftb` directory contains two files,

``` wp-block-preformatted
$ cd 1_dftb
$ ls
dftb_01.hsd  runDFTB.sh
```

These files correspond to `qmcnt` and `qmexe` illustrated in [Section
15.1](genesis_tutorial_15.1_2022.md#interface). `dftb_01.hsd` is a template
file to create an input file for DFTB+, and `runDFTB.sh` is a file to
invoke DFTB+. Let's look into these files in more details.

All the input parameters for DFTB+ must be present in `dftb_01.hsd`
except for the Geometry section (QM coordinates) and the ElectricField
section (MM coordinates), which are supplemented by GENESIS in runtime.

``` wp-block-preformatted
Hamiltonian = DFTB {
   SCC                = Yes                        (1)
   ThirdOrderFull     = Yes
   Charge             = 0.0                        (2)
   ReadInitialCharges = Yes                        (3)
   SlaterKosterFiles  = Type2FileNames {
     Prefix = "/path/to/dftb/slako/3ob-3-1/"       (4)
     Separator = "-"
     Suffix = ".skf"
   }
   HubbardDerivs {
     H = -0.1857
     C = -0.1492
     N = -0.1535
     O = -0.1575
   }
   HCorrection = Damping {
     Exponent = 4.05
   }
   MaxAngularMomentum {
     H = "s"                                       (5)
     C = "p"
     N = "p"
     O = "p"
   }
   Filling = Fermi {
     Temperature [Kelvin] = 0.0
   }
 }

 Analysis = {
   CalculateForces = Yes                           (6)
 }
```

\(1\) Perform self-consistent charge (SCC) DFTB.\
(2) The charge of the QM system, Ala~3~, is set to zero.\
(3) Restart from the previous SCC charge.\
(4) Change "/path/to" to the directory of your SK files.\
(5) Specify the atoms in Ala~3~.\
(6) We need the forces in addition to the energy.

As for `runDFTB.sh`, the path to DFTB+ must be specified in the first
part of the file shown below.

``` wp-block-preformatted
# -----------------------------------------------
# Settings for DFTB+
#
# --- Set the path for DFTB+ ---
export PATH=/path/to/dftbplus-23.1/_install/bin:$PATH   (1)

# (optional)
# --- Set a file to read initial charges ---
# initial='../charges.bin_save'                         (2)
```

\(1\) Specify the path to the bin directory of DFTB+.\
(2) Optionally, specify a SCC charge file obtained in the previous step.
In the first step, the DFTB job restarts using the SCC charge contained
in this file.

The rest of the file can be used as is, unless you have special reasons
to make a change.

#### [2. Ala~3~ in a water-sphere]{#2_Ala3_in_a_water-sphere} {#ala3-in-a-water-sphere .wp-block-heading}

`2_system` directory contains the pdb/crd and psf of a system, i.e.,
Ala~3~ in water.

``` wp-block-preformatted
$ cd 2_system
$ ls
snapshot50.crd  snapshot50.pdb  snapshot50.psf  snapshot50.vmd
```

The system can be visualized using VMD,

``` wp-block-preformatted
$ vmd -e snapshot50.vmd
```

<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized">
<img src="wp-content/uploads/2019/02/cut.png" class="wp-image-7633"
style="width:327px;height:313px" data-fetchpriority="high"
decoding="async"
srcset="wp-content/uploads/2019/02/cut.png 690w, wp-content/uploads/2019/02/cut-300x288.png 300w, wp-content/uploads/2019/02/cut-20x20.png 20w, wp-content/uploads/2019/02/cut-30x30.png 30w, wp-content/uploads/2019/02/cut-40x38.png 40w"
sizes="(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px" width="690" height="662" />
</figure>

You will find a cluster system, where the solute, Ala~3~, is located in
the center of a sphere surrounded by a layer of water molecules of 20 Ã…
thickness. The current version of GENESIS does not support periodic
boundary condition (PBC) for QM/MM, and thus QM/MM must be carried out
in noBC using a cluster system. In [Section
16.3](genesis_tutorial_16.3.md), we will illustrate how to prepare such
systems.

#### [3. QM/MM calculation]{#3_QMMM_calculation} {#qmmm-calculation .wp-block-heading}

Let's move into a directory of QM/MM calculations:

``` wp-block-preformatted
$ cd 3_qmmm/
$ ls 
qmmm_min.inp  qmmm_nvt.inp  qmmm_nvt.vmd  script.sh
```

`qmmm_min.inp `and `qmmm_nvt.inp` are control files to perform
minimization and MD, respectively. The control parameters are the same
as the previous ones (see [tutorial
3.2](genesis_tutorial_3.2_2019.md){rel="noreferrer noopener"
aria-label="tutorial 3.2 (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank"}, for
example), so we only describe the parameters that are specific to QM/MM
calculations. There are two important points.

##### [3.1. Setting up a QM/MM potential]{#31_Setting_up_a_QMMM_potential} {#setting-up-a-qmmm-potential .wp-block-heading}

The first is, of course, to specify a QM/MM potential. The potential is
controlled by \[ENERGY\] and \[QMMM\] sections. The \[ENERGY\] section
sets the parameters for the MM force field.

``` wp-block-preformatted
[ENERGY]
forcefield          = CHARMM
electrostatic       = CUTOFF       (1)
switchdist          = 16.0         (2)
cutoffdist          = 18.0
pairlistdist        = 19.5
vdw_force_switch    = YES
```

\(1\) CUTOFF must be specified for noBC instead of PME.\
(2) A longer cutoff length is recommended than in PME.

In the case of AMBER force field, just change the "forcefield" to AMBER.
Other keywords are the same. Note that the AMBER force field doesn't use
a switching function in general. Although it is OK with PME, it causes a
discontinuity in the energy when `electrostatic=CUTOFF`. One can avoid
this issue by setting a VERY long cutoff distance, but then it will
cause an overhead in the calculation of pairwise interaction. Therefore,
we made the switching function available also for AMBER force field in
GENESIS.

The \[QMMM\] section controls QM calculations.

``` wp-block-preformatted
[QMMM]
qmtyp               = dftb+                      (1)
qmcnt               = ../1_dftb/dftb_01.hsd      (2)
qmexe               = ../1_dftb/runDFTB.sh
qmatm_select_index  = 1                          (3)
workdir             = /dev/shm/qmmm_min          (4)
savedir             = qmmm_min                   (5)
basename            = job                        (6)
qmsave_period       = 10                         (7)
qmmaxtrial          = 1                          (8)

[SELECTION]
group1  = segid:PROA                             (3)
group2  = atomno:19
```

\(1\) Use DFTB+.\
(2) A template input file and a run script file for DFTB+.\
(3) QM atoms (=Ala~3~) are specified using the selector.\
(4) A working directory where input/output of QM jobs are written/read.\
(5) A directory where QM files are stored.\
(6) The basename of QM files.\
(7) The frequency to save QM files.\
(8) When the QM job fails, GENESIS restarts the job up to this number of
iteration.

In the above example, DFTB calculations are carried out for Ala~3~ (42
atoms) surrounded by point charges (MM atoms). The input and output
files of DFTB+ are created in a directory specified by `workdir`.
Because DFTB is fast, it is recommended to use a fast disk, such as RAM
disk, NVMe-SSD, etc, so as to avoid file I/O bottleneck. The DFTB+ files
are then copied and saved in a directory `savedir` every 10 steps.

##### [3.2. Setting up a spherical potential]{#32_Setting_up_a_spherical_potential} {#setting-up-a-spherical-potential .wp-block-heading}

Secondly, we setup a spherical potential. This is needed for simulations
in noBC, since otherwise the (water) molecules at the boundary may
evaporate and run away to infinity. The spherical potential has no
effect on atoms that are inside of the sphere, but pulls back those that
went out of the sphere. The functional form of the potential reads,

\\( \\displaystyle V\_{sph} = k\_{const} \\left( r -- r_b \\right )\^n
\\ (r \\geq r_b), \\\\ \\displaystyle \\hspace{16pt} = 0 \\ (r \< r_b),
\\)

where \\( r \\) is a distance from the center, and \\( k\_{const}\\) and
\\( r_b \\) are the force constant and the radius of the sphere,
respectively. We specify the parameters in the \[BOUNDARY\] section as
follow,

``` wp-block-preformatted
[BOUNDARY]
type          = NOBC
spherical_pot        = yes           (1)
constant             = 10.0          (2)
exponent             = 2             (3)
nindex               = 1             (4)
center_select_index1 = 2             (5)
radius1              = 20.0          (6)
fix_layer            = 1.0           (7)

[SELECTION]
group1  = segid:PROA
group2  = atomno:19                  (5)
```

\(1\) invoke the spherical potential.\
(2) \\( k\_{const}\\) in kcal/mol/Ã…^2^.\
(3) The exponent of the potential. Usually, "2" is recommended.\
(4) The number of spheres.\
(5) The center of the sphere specified by the selector.\
(6) The radius of a sphere in Ã….\
(7) The thickness of a layer of fixed atoms.

In this example, a spherical potential with a radius of 20 Ã… is created
around the 19th atom (CA of Ala~3~). Note that the center does **NOT**
follow the motion of the CA atom. The position of the CA atom is
referred only once at the beginning, and the center of the sphere is
kept fixed during the simulation. The atoms that are out of the sphere
in the initial structure (snapshot50.crd) are kept fixed. Furthermore, a
layer of fixed atom can be controlled using `fix_layer`. In the above
example, the atoms that are farther than 19 Ã… from the center are kept
fixed.

The information of the potential and the fixed atoms is written in a
restart file. Thus, in the subsequent calculations (e.g.,
`qmmm_nvt.inp`), the same potential is applied by reading a restart file
in the \[INPUT\] section and setting `spherical_pot = yes` in the
\[BOUNDARY\] section.

``` wp-block-preformatted
[INPUT]
rstfile = qmmm_min.rst

[BOUNDARY]
 type          = NOBC
 spherical_pot = yes
 restart       = yes
```

##### [3.3. Running a QM/MM job]{#33_Running_a_QMMM_job} {#running-a-qmmm-job .wp-block-heading}

We are now ready to run the job. `script.sh` is a bash script to run the
job. Here, we assume that the computer has 16 cores per node, and that
we want to run a job with (16 thread x 1MPI). In order to run a
16-thread job, we set an environment variable,

``` wp-block-preformatted
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=16
export  QM_NUM_THREADS=16
```

`OMP_NUM_THREADS` is for GENESIS/atdyn and `QM_NUM_THREADS` is for a QM
program. Usually, they are set to be the same number.

In [OpenMPI](https://www.open-mpi.org/){rel="noreferrer noopener"
aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank"} (since around 1.10),
the process is bound to a single core by default when the number of MPI
processes is â‰¤ 2. Therefore, a simple command

``` wp-block-preformatted
mpirun -np 1 atdyn qmmm_min.inp >& qmmm_min.out
```

would be carried out using only one core, thereby being **extremely
slow**. To avoid this issue, one needs to specify the mapping of cores
to each MPI processes. For example, `--map-by node:pe=N` assigns N
process element (cores) in a node to each MPI processes, and is suitable
for the present purpose.

``` wp-block-preformatted
mpirun -np 1 --map-by node:pe=${QM_NUM_THREADS} atdyn qmmm_min.inp >& qmmm_min.out
mpirun -np 1 --map-by node:pe=${QM_NUM_THREADS} atdyn qmmm_nvt.inp >& qmmm_nvt.out
```

There are alternatives such as `-bind-to socket` (to run the job using 1
CPU); consult the manual of OpenMPI for further details. It is a good
practice to add `-display-map` to monitor the mapping of cores to each
MPI processes.

In
[IntelMPI](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/components/mpi-library.html){rel="noreferrer noopener"
aria-label="IntelMPI (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank"}, there is no
such complexity, and the following command should work.

``` wp-block-preformatted
mpirun -np 1 -ppn 1 atdyn qmmm_min.inp >& qmmm_min.out 
mpirun -np 1 -ppn 1 atdyn qmmm_nvt.inp >& qmmm_nvt.out
```

Now type the following command to run the job,

``` wp-block-preformatted
$ chmod +x script.sh ../1_dftb/runDFTB.sh
$ ./script.sh 
```

Upon successful run, you will find the following message in output files
(`qmmm_min.out` and `qmmm_nvt.out`) showing that 42 atoms of Ala~3~ are
selected as QM atoms,

``` wp-block-preformatted
Setup_QMMM> Setup QM region
QM assignment info
1  PROA 1 ALA CAY CT3 assigned to QM atom 1  of element: C 6
2  PROA 1 ALA HY1 HA3 assigned to QM atom 2  of element: H 1
3  PROA 1 ALA HY2 HA3 assigned to QM atom 3  of element: H 1
4  PROA 1 ALA HY3 HA3 assigned to QM atom 4  of element: H 1
...
42 PROA 3 ALA HT3 HA3 assigned to QM atom 42 of element: H 1
number of QM atoms = 42
```

The input/output files of DFTB+ are found in `qmmm_min.1` and
`qmmm_nvt.1` directories,

``` wp-block-preformatted
$ ls qmmm_min.1 
job0.inp   job0.log   job0_charges.bin   job0_detailed.out
job10.inp  job10.log  job10_charges.bin  job10_detailed.out
...
```

The minimization will finish in 5 minutes, but the MD simulation will
take 4 hours or so. Grab a coffee and get relaxed!

When the MD is finished, the resulting trajectory, `qmmm_nvt.dcd`, can
be visualized using VMD,

``` wp-block-preformatted
$ vmd -e qmmm_nvt.vmd
```

You will see that Ala~3~ and water molecules in the central region
propagate in time, while the water molecules in the outlayer are kept
fixed.

#### [4. Analysis]{#4_Analysis} {#analysis .wp-block-heading}

The analysis can be done in the same was as in the previous section (see
[tutorial 3.2](genesis_tutorial_3.2_2019.md){rel="noreferrer noopener"
target="_blank"}, for example). In 4_analysis directory, there are two
script files,

``` wp-block-preformatted
$ cd 4_analysis
$ ls
minimize.gpi  minimize.sh*  temp.gpi      temp.sh*
$ ./minimize.sh
$ ./temp.sh
```

The command creates minimize.pdf and temp.pdf. The former shows the
variation of the energy and maximum gradient along the minimization
step,

<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized">
<img src="wp-content/uploads/2020/12/minimize.jpg"
class="wp-image-15419" style="width:482px;height:241px" decoding="async"
srcset="wp-content/uploads/2020/12/minimize.jpg 800w, wp-content/uploads/2020/12/minimize-300x150.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2020/12/minimize-768x384.jpg 768w, wp-content/uploads/2020/12/minimize-20x10.jpg 20w, wp-content/uploads/2020/12/minimize-30x15.jpg 30w, wp-content/uploads/2020/12/minimize-40x20.jpg 40w"
sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" width="800" height="400" />
</figure>

and the latter gives the variation of temperature along the simulation
time,

<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized">
<img src="wp-content/uploads/2020/12/temp.jpg" class="wp-image-15420"
style="width:469px;height:235px" decoding="async"
