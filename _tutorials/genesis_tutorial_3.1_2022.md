# MD simulation of alanine-dipeptide in the gas-phase 

##  Preparation

All the files required for this tutorial are hosted in the 
[GENESIS tutorials repository on
GitHub](https://github.com/genesis-release-r-ccs/genesis_tutorial_materials).

If you haven't downloaded the files yet, open your terminal 
and run the following command (see more in 
[Tutorial 1.1](/tutorials/genesis_tutorial_1.1_2022/)):

```bash
$ cd ~/GENESIS_Tutorials-2022
# if not yet
$ git clone https://github.com/genesis-release-r-ccs/genesis_tutorial_materials
```

If you already have the tutorial materials, let's go to our working directory:

```bash
$ cd genesis_tutorial_materials
```

This tutorial consists of three steps: 1) system setup, 2)
MD simulation, and 3) trajectory analysis. GENESIS control file in each
step is already included in the download file. To use the CHARMM36m
force field parameters [^1], let's create a symbolic link to the CHARMM
toppar directory (see [Tutorial 2.2](/tutorials/genesis_tutorial_2.2_2022/)), and in
addition, create a symbolic link to the GENESIS bin directory (see [Tutorial 1.1](/tutorials/genesis_tutorial_1.1_2022/)).


```bash
# Let's take a note
$ echo "tutorial-3.1: MD simulation of alanine-dipeptide in gas" >> README

# Check out the contents in Tutorial 3.1
$ cd tutorial-3.1
$ ln -s ../../Data/Parameters/toppar_c36_jul21 ./toppar
$ ln -s ../../Programs/genesis-2.0.0/bin ./bin
$ ls 
1_setup  2_runmd  3_trjana  bin  toppar
```

##  1. Setup 

In this tutorial, we will simulate alanine-dipeptide in the gas phase,
i.e., without solvent molecules. First, we build a system using
VMD/PSFGEN from a PDB file of the alanine-dipeptide. The scheme is the
same as in Steps1 and 3 of [Tutorial 2.3](/tutorials/genesis_tutorial_2.3_2022/). We obtain
`proa.pdb` and `proa.psf` as the input files for GENESIS. The peptide
has one alanine residue, with the N- and C-termini capped by acetyl
(CH<sub>3</sub>CO-) and N-methyl (-NHCH<sub>3</sub>) groups, respectively. This structure
has already been optimized by energy minimization and there are no
clashes between atoms. Therefore, MD simulations can be started
immediately. Note that in most cases, energy minimization is required
before MD simulation (e.g. [Tutorials 3.2](/tutorials/genesis_tutorial_3.2_2022/) and [3.3](/tutorials/genesis_tutorial_3.3_2022/)).


```bash
# Change directory for the system setup
$ cd 1_setup
$ ls
1_oripdb  2_psfgen

# Step1: Make a symbolic link to the original PDB file
$ cd 1_oripdb
$ ln -s ../../../../Data/PDB/ala2.pdb ./

# Step2: Make PDB and PSF files 
$ cd ../2_psfgen
$ ls
build.tcl

$ vmd -dispdev text -e build.tcl > log 
$ ls
build.tcl  log  proa.pdb  proa.psf

# View the initial structure 
$ vmd proa.pdb -psf proa.psf 
```

##  2. MD simulation

To run the MD simulation of this peptide, change the directory to
`2_runmd`. This directory already contains the GENESIS control file.
Let's look at it and check the simulation conditions.


```bash
# Change directory to run MD simulation
$ cd ../../2_runmd
$ ls
INP

# View the control file
$ less INP
```

In the control file, the `[INPUT]` section specifies the topology and
parameter files for the CHARMMC36m force field. The psf and pdb files
created in Step1 are also specified. In the `[OUTPUT]` section, the
filename of the coordinates trajectory data obtained from the MD
simulation is specified with `dcdfile`. Since the system is in the gas
phase, non-bonded interactions are calculated with the usual cutoff
scheme (`electrostatic = CUTOFF`) instead of the Ewald method.
Therefore, we need to use as long a cutoff distance as possible. Here we
calculate the potential energy with the cutoff distance of 49 Ã…, as
specified in the `[ENERGY]` section.

We use the velocity Verlet integrator (VVER) with a time step of 2 fs
(`[DYNAMICS]`), where the SHAKE [^2] and RATTLE algorithms [^3] are
used for constraining the bond length involving hydrogen
(`[CONSTRAINTS]`). The energy and coordinates are output every 500 steps
(`[DYNAMICS]`). We use the Bussi thermostat [^4] to keep the
temperature constant at 298.15 K (`[ENSEMBLE]`). Since the system is the
gas-phase, we do not use the periodic boundary condition, namely,
boundary type is set to `NOBC` (no boundary condition) (`[BOUNDARY]`).
We carry out a 1-ns MD simulation (nsteps = 500000).


```toml
[INPUT]
topfile = ../toppar/top_all36_prot.rtf   # topology file
parfile = ../toppar/par_all36m_prot.prm  # parameter file
psffile = ../1_setup/2_psfgen/proa.psf   # protein structure file
pdbfile = ../1_setup/2_psfgen/proa.pdb   # PDB file
 
[OUTPUT]
dcdfile = md.dcd             # Coordinates trajectory file

[ENERGY]
forcefield       = CHARMM    # CHARMM force field
electrostatic    = CUTOFF    # cutoff scheme is used
switchdist       =   48.0    # switch distance
cutoffdist       =   49.0    # cutoff distance
pairlistdist     =   50.0    # pair-list distance
 
[DYNAMICS]
integrator       =   VVER    # velocity Verlet
nsteps           = 500000    # number of MD steps
timestep         =  0.002    # timestep (ps)
eneout_period    =    500    # energy output period
crdout_period    =    500    # coordinates output period
stoptr_period    =     10    # remove translational and rotational motions
 
[CONSTRAINTS]
rigid_bond       = YES       # use SHAKE/RATTLE
 
[ENSEMBLE] 
ensemble         = NVT       # Canonical ensemble 
tpcontrol        = BUSSI     # Bussi thermostat 
temperature      = 298.15    # initial and target temperature (K)

[BOUNDARY]
type             = NOBC      # non-periodic system
```

Now let's run GENESIS. ATDYN is more suitable than SPDYN for this
simulation because the peptide is very small and the system is
non-periodic. Here we specify one OpenMP thread and use only one CPU
core for the calculation (see the [Usage page](/docs/usage/) for details). The simulation takes approximately 20 seconds. Specifying
`> log` on the command line will write the output message to `log`
(this procedure is called "[Redirection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redirection_(computing))"). if `> log` is omitted, the message will be
displayed in the terminal window.


```bash
# Run the MD simulation (it takes ~20 seconds)
$ export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
$ ../bin/atdyn INP > log
```

After the simulation is finished, we can obtain `md.dcd` and `log` as
the "coordinates" and "energy" trajectory of the system, respectively.
Let's visualize the coordinates trajectory with VMD. Click the "Play"
button in the VMD main window. You can see that the atoms of the peptide
are moving fast, including the rotation of dihedral angles.


```bash
# Check the output files
$ ls
INP  log  md.dcd

# View the MD trajectory using VMD
$ vmd ../1_setup/2_psfgen/proa.pdb -dcd md.dcd
```

![](/assets/images/2022_04_Figure3.1_VMD.png)

 The resulting DCD file is a binary file, not
a text file. So, even if you use the `less` command for the dcd file,
its contents cannot be visually confirmed by human eyes. In [Tutorial 4.1](/tutorials/genesis_tutorial_4.1_2022/), you will
learn how to handle DCD files.

Also, let's take a look at the `log` file with the `less` command.


```bash
# View the log file
$ less log
```

In the middle of the `log` file, there are many lines beginning with
`INFO:`. In these lines, system information at each step is displayed,
where `STEP` is the number of MD steps, `TIME` is the simulation time
(in picoseconds), `TOTAL_ENE` is the sum of the potential energy
(`POTENTIAL_ENE`) and kinetic energy (`KINETIC_ENE`), `RMSG` is the
gradient of the potential energy averaged over all atoms
(root-mean-square gradient). The components of the potential energy of
the CHARMM force field are then displayed (bond, angle, Urey-Bradley, dihedral angle, improper torsion angle, CMAP, van der Waals, Coulomb).
`TEMPERATURE` is the system temperature, which is calculated from the
kinetic energy and velocities by \\(K\_\mathrm{e} = 1/2 \sum m_i v_i^2 = 3/2 Nk\_\mathrm{B}T\\). The
unit of the energy is kcal/mol, and temperature is Kelvin.

```

 Please note that your detailed results may
differ from the above results. The main reason is that the initial
velocities of atoms vary depending on the random number seed, and the
seed is automatically determined according to the time the program is
executed, unless you specify a seed value. If you want to fix the
initial seed value, set `iseed` explicitly in the `[DYNAMICS]` section
(see the User manual).

 `VOLUME` is the volume of the system. In
this case, zero is output, since we employed the gas-phase. If periodic
system is simulated as in [Tutorial 3.2](/tutorials/genesis_tutorial_3.2_2022/), the
volume of the simulation box is displayed in this column.

At the end of the `log` file, detailed computation times for this
simulation are displayed, with timers for energy calculation,
integrator, pair list making, and so on. `setup` is the time taken to
start the MD simulation, including loading the input file and initial
memory allocation, and `dynamics` represents the time for pure MD
simulation, excluding initial setup. It can be seen that the most time
consuming part is the non-bonded energy calculation (van der Waals and Coulomb terms).

##  3. Trajectory analysis

Now let's analyze the energy and conformational changes of the peptide
from the trajectory data.


```bash
# Change directory for trajectory analysis 
$ cd ../3_trjana/ 
$ ls 
1_energy  2_dihedral
```

### 3.1 Energy 

Let's plot the time course of the potential energy using Gnuplot. First,
pick up the lines containing `INFO:` from the `log` file with the
`grep` command and write them into a new file `energy.log`. Then, plot
the 5th column, which corresponds to the total potential energy. You can
see that the energy fluctuates around a certain value.


```bash
# Change directory for trajectory analysis
$ cd 1_energy

# Select lines that contain "INFO:" using the "grep" command
$ grep "INFO:" ../../2_runmd/log > energy.log
$ less energy.log

# View the time courses of energy using gnuplot
$ gnuplot
gnuplot> set key autotitle columnhead
gnuplot> set xlabel "Time (ps)"
gnuplot> set ylabel "Potential energy (kcal/mol)"
gnuplot> plot 'energy.log' using 3:5 with lines
```

![](/assets/images/2022_03_tutorial3.1-figure2.png)

If you want to pick up the columns of time (3rd column) and total
potential energy (5th column) at the same time, the `awk` command is
useful:


```bash
# Pick up the 3rd and 5th columns
$ awk '{print $3, $5}' energy.log > potential_ene.log
$ less potential_ene.log
```

Now let's calculate the averaged potential energy from
`potential_ene.log`. The averaged value for each column can be quickly
calculated with the `awk` command. The following is an example,
analyzing the 2nd column of `potential_ene.log`. This file consists of
1,002 lines, and the first two lines (header information and initial step energy) are skipped in the analysis.


```bash
# Compute the averaged potential energy using the tail and awk commands
$ tail -1000 potential_ene.log > tmp
$ awk '{sum+=$2} END {print sum/NR}' tmp
-1.30413

# The above two commands can be combined with the pipeline "|"
$ tail -1000 potential_ene.log | awk '{sum+=$2} END {print sum/NR}'
-1.30413
```

### 3.2 Dihedral angle 

We analyze the conformational changes of the peptide using the GENESIS
trajectory analysis tool. The peptide has two major variables that can
describe its conformation: Ï† and Ïˆ (backbone dihedral angle). Ï† is the
dihedral angle of the C-N-CÎ±-C atoms and Ïˆ is the dihedral angle of the
N-CÎ±-C-N atoms. The `trj_analysis` tool is used to analyze these
dihedral angles, whose control file is shown below.

![](/assets/images/2019_07_ala2_dihed.jpg){: width="400"}


```bash
# Change directory for the analysis of dihedral angles
$ cd ../2_dihedral
$ ls
INP

# View the control file (see below)
$ less INP
```

We specify the input and output files in the `[INPUT]` and `[OUTPUT]`
sections. In the `[TRAJECTORY]` section, we specify the number of MD
steps and coordinates output period corresponding to the DCD file to be
analyzed and the nsteps and crdout_period in the ATDYN control file,
respectively (for details on `[TRAJECTORY]`, see the FAQ). The
`[OPTION]` section sets the list of atoms to be used in the dihedral
angle calculation. These atom names should be written carefully by
looking at the molecular structure in VMD or by checking the PDB file.
Here, the syntax for atom selection is
\[segment_name\]:\[residue_id\]:\[residue_name\]:\[atom_name\]. In
particular, PROA:1:ALAD:CA means the CÎ± atom of ALAD1 in segment:PROA.

We specify the input and output files in the `[INPUT]` and `[OUTPUT]`
sections. In the `[TRAJECTORY]` section, we specify the DCD file to be
analyzed, and also total number of MD steps (`md_step`) and MD output
period (`mdout_period`), each of which is corresponding to `nsteps` and
`crdout_period` in the control file of ATDYN, respectively (For more detailed description of the `[TRAJECTORY]` section, see [Appendix 1](/tutorials/genesis_tutorial_appendix_1_2022/)). In the
`[OPTION]` section, we set atom lists to be used for the dihedral angle
calculation. These atom names should be written carefully by looking at
the molecular structure in VMD or by checking the PDB file. Here, the
syntax of the atom selection is
\[segnemt_name\]:\[residue_id\]:\[residue_name\]:\[atom_name\]. In
particular, `PROA:1:ALAD:CA` means the CÎ± atom of ALAD1 in
`segment:PROA`.


```toml
[INPUT]
psffile       = ../../1_setup/2_psfgen/proa.psf  # protein structure file
reffile       = ../../1_setup/2_psfgen/proa.pdb  # PDB file
 
[OUTPUT]
torfile       = output.tor              # torsion file
 
[TRAJECTORY]
trjfile1      = ../../2_runmd/md.dcd    # trajectory file
md_step1      = 500000                  # number of MD steps
mdout_period1 = 500                     # MD output period
ana_period1   = 500                     # analysis period
repeat1       = 1
trj_format    = DCD                     # (PDB/DCD)
trj_type      = COOR+BOX                # (COOR/COOR+BOX)
trj_natom     = 0                       # (0:uses reference PDB atom count)

[OPTION]
torsion1      = PROA:1:ALAD:CLP  PROA:1:ALAD:NL  PROA:1:ALAD:CA   PROA:1:ALAD:CRP
torsion2      = PROA:1:ALAD:NL   PROA:1:ALAD:CA  PROA:1:ALAD:CRP  PROA:1:ALAD:NR
```

Let's run `trj_analysis`. As an output file, we get `output.tor`, where
columns 1 to 3 correspond to the snapshot index, the dihedral angle of
torsion1 (Ï†), and torsion2 (Ïˆ), respectively. Finally, let us plot the
time courses of Ï† and Ïˆ and the distribution of Ï† and Ïˆ in
two-dimensional space.


```bash
# Analyze the time courses of dihedral angle PHI and PSI
$ ../../bin/trj_analysis INP > log
$ ls
INP  log  output.tor

# Time courses of the dihedral angles phi and psi
$ gnuplot
gnuplot> set xlabel 'Time (ps)'
gnuplot> set ylabel 'Dihedral angle (deg)'
gnuplot> set key top outside
gnuplot> plot [][-180:180]'output.tor' u 1:2 t "phi", 'output.tor' u 1:3 t "psi"
```

![](/assets/images/2022_03_tutorial3.1-figure4.png)


```bash
# Distribution of the dihedral angles phi and psi
$ gnuplot
gnuplot> set xlabel 'phi (deg)'
gnuplot> set ylabel 'psi (deg)'
gnuplot> unset key
gnuplot> set size square
gnuplot> plot [-180:180][-180:180]'output.tor' u 2:3
```

![](/assets/images/2022_03_tutorial3.1-figure5.png)

We can see that the backbone dihedral angles of the alanine-dipeptide
are predominantly distributed in the Î²-sheet region around (Ï†, Ïˆ) =
(-139, 135) rather than in the Î±-helix region around (Ï†, Ïˆ) = (-57, -47).
