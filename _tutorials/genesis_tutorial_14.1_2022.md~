## 1. Introduction

### 1. 1. Free-energy perturbation (FEP)

The free-energy difference between two states, A and B, can be estimated
by the following statistical thermodynamics relation:

<div>
\[
\begin{aligned}
\Delta G &= G_B - G_A \\
        &= -k_B T \ln \frac{
            \int {\rm d}x\, \exp[-\beta U_B(x)]
        }{
            \int {\rm d}x\, \exp[-\beta U_A(x)]
        } \\
        &= -k_B T \ln \frac{
            \int {\rm d}x\, \exp[-\beta U_A(x) - \beta \Delta U(x)]
        }{
            \int {\rm d}x\, \exp[-\beta U_A(x)]
        } \\
        &= -k_B T \ln \left\langle \exp[-\beta \Delta U(x)] \right\rangle_A
\end{aligned}
\]
</div>



where *G* and *U* are the free energy and potential energy of state A or
B, and \\( \\Delta U\\) is the difference between \\(U_A\\) and \\(U_B\\).
According to this equation, \\( \\Delta G\\) can be estimated by
sampling only equilibrium configurations of state A and calculating the
"perturbation", hence this method is called "free-energy perturbation
(FEP)".

However, if the difference between states A and B is large (i.e., the
perturbation is too large), there is little overlap between the energy
distributions (left of Figure 1) and the configurations at state B are
poorly sampled by simulations in state A, leading to large statistical
errors. To reduce such errors, n−2 intermediate states are inserted
between states A and B in order to obtain overlapped energy
distributions (right of Figure 1). The potential energy of intermediate
state i is defined by

<div>
\[
\begin{aligned}
    U(\lambda_i) = (1-\lambda_i)U_A + \lambda_iU_B,
\end{aligned}
\]
</div>


where \\(\\lambda_i\\) is the scaling parameter coupling the initial and final
states. By changing \\(\\lambda_i\\) from 0 to 1, states A and B can be smoothly
connected. \\( \\Delta G\\) can be estimated by calculating the
summation of free-energy changes between adjacent states:

<div>
\[
\begin{aligned}
    \Delta G = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \Delta G_i = - k_BT \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \ln \left\langle\exp[-\beta
    (U(\lambda_{i+1}) - U(\lambda_i)) \right\rangle_{\lambda_i},
\end{aligned}
\]
</div>


where the subscript \\(\\lambda_i\\) represents the ensemble average at state *i*.
Since the free energy depends only on the initial and final states, any
configuration of intermediate states can be chosen, regardless of
whether or not the states are physically realizable. If the intermediate
states are physically unrealizable but computationally realizable, the
calculation and thermodynamic process are referred to as alchemical
free-energy calculation and alchemical process, respectively.

### 1. 2  Relative solvation free energy

Using an alchemical processes, the FEP method can be applied to the
calculation of solvation free energies of solutes. The relative
solvation free energy \\(\\Delta \\Delta G\_{\rm solv}\\) is defined as the
difference between the absolute solvation free energies of two solutes:
\\(\\Delta \\Delta G\_{\rm solv} = \\Delta G\_{\rm solv}^{B} -- \\Delta
G\_{\rm solv}^{A}\\). In calculations of absolute solvation free energies,
the free-energy change upon the transfer of the solute from vacuum (=
the solute does not interact with any other molecules) to the solvent (=
the solute interacts with water molecules) must be calculated. In
general, since all the interactions of the ligand are included in the
perturbation, many intermediate states are required to keep the
statistical error within an acceptable range. In contrast, from the
thermodynamic cycle shown in Figure 2, \\(\\Delta \\Delta G\_{\rm solv}\\)
can be calculated by mutation from A to B (instead of calculating
absolute solvation free energies): \\(\\Delta \\Delta G\_{\rm solv}=\\Delta
G\_{\rm mut}^{\rm solvent}- \\Delta G\_{\rm mut}^{\rm vacuum}\\), where \\(\\Delta
G\_{\rm mut}^{\rm solvent}\\) and \\(\\Delta G\_{\rm mut}^{\rm vacuum}\\) are the free
energy changes upon mutation from A to B in solvent and vacuum,
respectively. Since the perturbation accompanying the mutation is small
(from a hydrogen atom of benzene to an OH group of phenol (right of
Figure 2)), the number of intermediate states can be reduced, thus
reducing the total error in the calculation.

energy and mutation of solute. (Right) Molecules A and B.

 

### 1. 3. Hybrid-topology approach

In order to mutate from benzene to phenol, we must consider the
differences in topologies and force field parameters between the two
molecules. For the case of benzene and phenol shown in Figure 2. the two
molecules have a common part (the benzene ring and five hydrogen atoms)
and a different part (H atom for benzene and OH group for phenol). The
common parts share the same topology but they differ in their charge
distribution as well as in the parameters for bonds, angles, and
dihedrals. The different atoms (H for benzene and OH for phenol) differ
in both their topology and force field parameters. In order to account
for the difference between the systems, we introduce the "hybrid
topology approach" [^1],[^2],[^3] to FEP simulations. In this approach, we
set them up such that the common part has a single topology, while the
different parts have a dual topology (Figure 3). Each part is hereafter
referred to as the single-topology or dual-topology part, respectively.

![](/assets/images/2022_02_fep_rel_solv_fig3.jpg)

Figure 3. The topologies of benzene and phenol are merged into a hybrid
topology.

During the FEP simulation, the topology of the single-topology part is
not changed, but its force field parameters (charge, LJ, and internal
bond) are gradually changed from state A to state B. In the
dual-topology part, both topologies and parameters are changed. In order
to smoothly connect states A and B, in the hybrid topology approach, the
potential energy is modified by lambda values (\\(\\lambda\_{\rm LJ}^{A},
\\lambda\_{\rm LJ}^{B}, \\lambda\_{\rm elec}^{A}, \\lambda\_{\rm elec}^{\rm B},
\\lambda\_{\rm bond}^{\rm A}, \\lambda\_{\rm bond}^{\rm B}\\)) which gradually change
from state A to state B. At the initial state corresponding to state A,
only the H atom of benzene exists in the dual-topology part and the
force field parameters correspond to those of benzene, while in the
final state corresponding to state B, only the OH atoms exist in the
dual-topology part and the force field parameters correspond to those of
phenol (Figure 4).

hybrid topology approach.

 

### 1. 4. Soft-core potentials

In the vicinity of the initial and the final states
(\\(\\lambda\_{\rm LJ}^{\rm A}, \\lambda\_{\rm LJ}^{\rm B}\\) = 0 or 1), overlap
between perturbed atoms or between perturbed and non-perturbed atoms can
lead to drastic energy changes. A situation in which the simulation
becomes unstable due to such overlaps is termed "end point catastrophe"
and can lead to an early termination of the simulation. In order to
avoid such a situation, soft-core potential is introduced to the LJ
potential [^4]. In GENESIS, in additon to the LJ potential, the
soft-core potential is applied to the electrostatic potentials [^5].
The formulas of the soft-core potentials are shown in GENESIS Users'
Manual.

 

### 1. 5. Functions available in GENESIS

GENESIS supports several types of alchemical calculations. Functions
implemented in GENESIS include hybrid and dual-topology calculation
methods, soft-core potentials, and lambda-exchange calculations based on
REMD. In addition, acceleration of FEP simulations is possible using
GPGPU. Currently, SPDYN supports only the CHARMM and AMBER force fields
for FEP simulations. FEP functions are only available in GENESIS version
1.x.x. GENESIS 2.0 does not support FEP yet. Full description of the
available functions is provided in the users' manual. In this tutorial,
we demonstrate the usage of FEP functions in GENESIS by calculating the
relative solvation free energy between methane and methanol.

 

## 2. System setup

### 2. 1. Overview of required input files

We will perform FEP simulations for obtaining the relative solvation
free energy of methane and methanol. The tutorial consists of two directories:
`methane-methanol` and `toppar`. The `methane-methanol` directory
includes `ligand` and `vacuum` directories, which contain input files
for performing FEP simulations in solvent and in vacuum, respectively.
The `toppar` directory contains CHARMM force field parameter files.


```bash
$ cd tutorial-14.1
$ ls
methane-methanol/  toppar/
$ cd methane-methanol
$ ls
README  calc_ddG.py  ligand/  vacuum/

# Setup the directory for binary files of GENESIS 2.1.X
$ export GENESIS_BIN_DIR=../../../GENESIS_Tutorials-2022/Programs/genesis-2.1.X/bin/
```

The `ligand` directory contains script files and input files for
calculating \\(\\Delta G\_{\rm mut}^{\rm solvent}\\).
`run_min.inp, run_eq1.inp, run_eq2.inp`, and `run_eq3.inp` are GENESIS
control files for minimization, heating, equilibration with restraints,
and equilibration without restraints, respectively.

`make_inp.sh` is a shell script for generating control file for the
production run of FEP simulations. `post_run.sh` is a shell script for
analysis. The `vacuum` directory contains respective input files for
calculatiing \\(\\Delta G\_{\rm mut}^{\rm vacuum}\\).


```bash
$ cd ligand
$ ls
run_eq.sh*      ligand.psf      output/         run_eq2.inp     run_fep2.inp
run_fepremd.sh* make_input.sh*  post_run.sh*    run_eq3.inp     run_min.inp
ligand.pdb      make_job.sh*    run_eq1.inp     run_fep1.inp
```

### 2. 2. Structure files for the hybrid-topology approach

To treat hybrid topology in GENESIS, the common parts of methane and
methanol (i.e., the single-topology part) are superimposed, meaning that
common atoms are duplicated (Figure 5). The duplication introduces
unnecessary degrees of freedom, and an error may occur if coordinates
and velocities of common atoms become different for the two systems. In
GENESIS, those additional degrees of freedom are removed, and the
coordinates and velocities of the common atoms are synchronized
throughout the FEP simulations.

![](/assets/images/2022_02_fep_rel_solv_fig5.jpg)

Figure 5. Representation of hybrid topology in GENESIS

An section of the PDB file is shown in Figure 6. The PDB file must
contain the coordinates for all atoms of solutes A (methane) and B
(methanol). Each solute is divided into single-topology and
dual-topology parts. The single-topology and dual-topology parts of the
initial state (methane: segment ID L0) are respectively referred to as
"singleA" and "dualA", while those of the final state (methanol: segment
ID L1) are referred to as "singleB" and "dualB", respectively. The atom
names, coordinates, and order of "singleA" atoms must be identical to
those of the "singleB" atoms, because the "singleA" and "singleB" parts
are treated as such in the FEP simulations. The PSF file corresponding
to the PDB file is also required.

![](/assets/images/2022_02_fep_rel_solv_fig6.jpg)

Figure 6. PDB and PSF files for the hybrid topology and definitions of
singleA, singleB, dualA, and dualB.

The PDB and PSF files for the hybrid-topology approach can be prepared
manually, but the process is troublesome and prone to error. Even a
minor difference between the coordinates or the order of "single A" and
"single B" atoms will lead to an early termination of the simulation.
Instead, creation of input files can be automated using the CHARMM-GUI
utility tools. The relative Ligand Solvator tool in CHARMM-GUI
automatically prepares PDB, PSF, and GENESIS input files for
hybrid-topology approach calculations. A solute can be easily mutated to
another using graphical user interface, and force field parameters for
solutes are automatically generated using ParamChem. The input files in
tutorial22-14.1.zip were generated by the CHARMM-GUI Relative Ligand
Solvator tool. However, some files were modified for the purpose of this
tutorial.

 

### 2. 3. The ALCHEMY section

Most input options in the GENESIS control file are identical to the ones
used in Tutorial 3.2, but here, the \[ALCHEMY\] section was added to set
the keywords related to FEP. To see available input options for the
\[ALCHEMY\] section, execute the following command:


```bash
# Show control options
$ $GENESIS_BIN_DIR/spdyn -h ctrl_all md
```

The output of the command is shown below. `fep_direction` represents
the direction of energy evaluation in FEP. BothSides, Forward, or
Reverse are available. The topology in FEP simulations is specified by
`fep_topology` (Hybrid or Dual). For hybrid topology,
`fep_topology = Hybrid` is set. The "singleA", "singleB", "dualA", and
"dualB" atoms of the ligands are assigned by the keywords:
`singleA, singleB, dualA,` and `dualB`, respectively. For these
keywords, we set the group numbers assigned in \[SELECTION\]. For
example, if `group1, group2, group3,` and `group4` are respectively
assigned to `singleA`, `singleB`, `dualA`, and `dualB` atoms in
\[SELECTION\] section, then we set
`singleA = 1, singleB = 2, dualA = 3,` and `dualB = 4`. fepout_period is
the frequency of output of energy difference. It must be larger than or
equal to `eneout_period`. `equilsteps` represents the number of
equilibration steps performed before the evaluation of energy
differences. In GENESIS, soft-core potentials are applied to the LJ
[^5] and electrostatic [^6] interactions between the dual-topology
atoms and the others. `sc_alpha` and `sc_beta` are the parameters of the
soft-core potentials for LJ and electrostatic interactions,
respectively.
`lambljA, lambljB, lambelA, lambelB, lambbondA, lambbondB,` and
`lambrest` represent values of \\(\\lambda\\) for LJ, electrostatics,
internal bonds, and restraints,
respectively.


```toml
# [ALCHEMY]
# fep_direction = Bothsides             # Fep direction [Bothsides, Forward, Reverse]
# fep_topology  = Hybrid                # Fep topology [Hybrid, Dual]

# ref_lambid    = 0                     # Reference window id for single FEP-MD
```

## 3. FEP simulations in solvent

### 3. 1. Minimization and equilibration

We carry out minimization and equilibration of the system with
alchemical perturbation before the production run. First, we carry out
the minimization in order to remove atomic clashes (or bad contacts) in
the initial structure. The following command executes the minimization
procedure:


```bash
# Perform minimization
$ $GENESIS_BIN_DIR/spdyn -np 8 run_min.inp > output/run_min.out
```

The important sections of the minimization control file are shown below.
`fep_direction, fepout_period,` and `equilsteps` are not used during the
minimization, and they can be omitted. In the \[SELECTION\] section,
`group1, group2, group3,` and `group4` are respectively assigned to
`singleA, singleB, dualA`, and `dualB` atoms defined in Figure 6. We
here set `lambljA` and `lambljB` to 1.0, denoting that methane and
methanol have full LJ interactions with the other atoms in the system.
Also, we set` lambelA, lambelB, lambbondA,` and `lambbondB` to 0.5.
lambrest is set to 1.0, but it can be omitted if the restraint is not
scaled by \\(\\lambda\\). The soft-core parameters for LJ and
electrostatic interactions are set to 5.0.


```toml
[ALCHEMY]
fep_topology = Hybrid
singleA      = 1 # Group number for singleA atoms
singleB      = 2 # Group number for singleB atoms
dualA        = 3 # Group number for dualA atoms
dualB        = 4 # Group number for dualB atoms
sc_alpha     = 5.0
sc_beta      = 5.0
lambljA      = 1.0
lambljB      = 1.0
lambelA      = 0.5
lambelB      = 0.5
lambbondA    = 0.5
lambbondB    = 0.5
lambrest     = 1.0

[SELECTION]
group1 = ai:1-4 and segid:L0    # group for singleA atoms
group2 = ai:6-9 and segid:L1  # group for singleB atoms
group3 = ai:5-5 and segid:L0   # group for dualA atoms
group4 = ai:10-11 and segid:L1 # group for dualB atoms
```

Next, we heat up the system from 0.1 K to 300 K. The following command
executes the heating procedure:


```bash
# Perform heating
$ $GENESIS_BIN_DIR/spdyn -np 8 run_eq1.inp > output/run_eq1.out
```

In FEP MD simulations, the energy difference (\\(\\Delta U\\)) between
two states is calculated. \\(\\lambda\\) values for each state are
specified by a column in
`lambljA, lambljB, lambelA, lambelB, lambbondA,` and `lambbondB`. In the
control file shown below, two columns of \\(\\lambda\\) values
correspond to two states. When 'Forward' is specified in
`fep_direction`, GENESIS performs a FEP simulation only at state 1 (left
column of \\(\\lambda\\) values) and calculates the energy difference
between states 1 and 2 (right column of \\(\\lambda\\) values) at
state 1. The energy difference is outputted to '`fepfile`' specified in
\[OUTPUT\]. In this example, \\(\\lambda\\) values of states 1 and 2 are
identical, therefore the energy difference is 0. `fepout_period` and
`equilsteps` should be specified, but these values are not used during
the equilibration.


```toml
[OUTPUT]       
dcdfile = output/run_eq1.dcd
rstfile = output/run_eq1.rst
fepfile = output/run_eq1.fepout

[ALCHEMY]
fep_direction = Forward
fep_topology  = Hybrid
singleA       = 1
singleB       = 2
dualA         = 3
dualB         = 4
fepout_period = 0
equilsteps    = 0
sc_alpha      = 5.0
sc_beta       = 0.5
lambljA       = 1.0 1.0
lambljB       = 1.0 1.0
lambelA       = 0.5 0.5
lambelB       = 0.5 0.5
lambbondA     = 0.5 0.5
lambbondB     = 0.5 0.5
```

Subsequently, we perform NPT equilibration with restraints (100 ps) and
NPT equilibration without restraints (100 ps). In those simulations, the
\[ALCHEMY\] section is identical to that of the heating simulation.
After the simulations have ended, it is recommended to check the log
files and confirm the trajectories using a visualization tool such as
VMD.


```bash
# Perform equilibration with positional restraints
$ $GENESIS_BIN_DIR/spdyn -np 8 input/run_eq2.inp > output/run_eq2.out

# Perform equilibration without the restraints
$ $GENESIS_BIN_DIR/spdyn -np 8 input/run_eq3.inp > output/run_eq3.out
```

### 3. 2. FEP/\\(\\lambda\\) REMD simulations

In this step, we perform the production run of the FEP simulations. To
enhance the sampling efficiency, FEP simulations at different
\\(\\lambda\\) values are coupled using the Hamiltonian replica exchange
method [^6],[^7]. Here, we prepare 12 replicas. The first and the last
replicas correspond to the initial and final states, respectively while
the other 10 replicas correspond to intermediate states. 12 replicas run
in parallel and exchange their parameters at fixed intervals during the
simulation. Exchanges between adjacent replicas are accepted or rejected
according to the Metropolis criterion.

We execute two 1-ns FEP/REMD simulations (`run_fep1.inp` and
`run_fep2.inp`) sequentially for a total of a 2-ns simulation. Input
files for sequential runs can be easily generated by the following
command:


```bash
# Execute the shell script for generation of input files
$ sh make_inp.sh
```

The simulation time can be modified in the "`make_inp.sh`" script (5-ns
by default).

The most important sections in `run_fep1.inp` are shown below. In the
FEP/\\(\\lambda\\)REMD simulation, \[REMD\] section is also required.
`type1` is set to `alchemy`, meaning that \\(\\lambda\\) values are
exchanged. `exchange_period` should be a multiple of `fepout_period`.
`nreplica1` specifies the number of replicas. In the \[ALCHEMY\]
section, `fep_direction` is set to `BothSides`. When `BothSides` is
specified, the energy differences between adjacent replicas are
calculated for each replica, i.e., for replica i, the energy differences
between i and i-1 and between i and i+1 are calculated and written to
the file specified by `fepfile` at the fixed intervals specified by
`fepout_period`. In Figure 7, fepfile is shown for replica 3 (window 3).
The `fepfile` files are used to calculate the free energy in the next
section "3.3. Analysis". The \\(\\lambda\\) values for each replica are
specified by `lambljA, lambljB, lambelA, lambelB, lambbondA,` and
`lambbondB`. The leftmost column of the \\(\\lambda\\) values
corresponds to the parameters for the initial state (i.e., methane), the
rightmost column corresponds to the parameters for the final state
(i.e., methanol), and the remaining columns correspond to the parameters
for the intermediate states. In this tutorial, we linearly change
`lambljA, lambljB, lambelA, lambelB, lambbondA,` and `lambbondB` along
replica IDs, as shown in Figure 8.

Figure 8. Values of lambda for electrostatic, LJ, and bonded
interactions.

The following command executes the FEP/\\(\\lambda\\)REMD simulation:


```bash
# Execute the control file for the lambda-exchange FEP simulation
# 8 MPI processes per replica, i.e. 8 * 12 = 96 processes are used here
$ $GENESIS_BIN_DIR/spdyn -np 96 input/run_fep1.inp > output/run_fep1.out
```

We perform a FEP/\\(\\lambda\\)REMD simulation using the r-RESPA
integrator with a 2.5-fs time step. Here, the length of the simulation
is 2 ns, which might not be sufficient for the convergence the
free-energy calculation. For obtainning more accurate results, it is
recommended to use a longer simulation time, in accordance with the
computational resources or time available to the user.

 

### 3. 3. Analysis

After the FEP/\\(\\lambda\\)REMD simulations have ended, we calculate
the free energy from fepfile. The `post_run.sh` script calculates the
free-energy difference between the initial and final states:


```bash
# Execute the shell script for analysis
$ sh post_run.sh
```

In the first part of the `post_run.sh` script, fepfile files are sorted
using `remd_convert` and energy differences for each parameter are
outputted (`par1.fepout` to `par12.fepout`). `remd_convert` is included
in GENESIS analysis tools. In the second part, the free-energy
differences between adjacent parameter sets are calculated from the
sorted files using the Bennett acceptance ratio (BAR) method [^8] (the
relevant section of the `post_run.sh` script is shown below). The BAR
method is performed using `mbar_analysis` in GENESIS analysis tools. The
number of simulations, number of replicas, number of steps, frequency of
replica exchange, frequency of energy output, and the temperature are
specified by `nrun, nrep, nsteps, exchange_period, fepout_period`, and
`temperature`, respectively. These parameters can be adapted according
to the user's system.


```bash
# set parameters of simulations
nrun=2
nrep=12
nsteps=400000
exchange_period=800
fepout_period=400
temperature=300
```

Finally, `post_run.sh` outputs a file named "fene.dat" (Figure 9), which
includes the free-energy differences along the parameter IDs. By
default, the trajectories are divided tino three blocks, and each column
in `fene.dat` represents the free-energy changes in each block (i.e.,
the block average of the free-energy changes are obtained). Each row
represents the free-energy change from the initial state (state A). The
last row corresponds to the free-energy change from the initial state to
the final state (state B), which is equal to \\(\\Delta
G\_{mut}\^{solvent}\\).

## 4. FEP simulations in vacuum

Next, we perform FEP simulations in vacuum to obtain \\(\\Delta
G\_{mut}\^{vacuum}\\) . Please change directory to "vacuum". Input files
for the vacuum simulations are very similar to those for the solvent
simulations, but there are some important differences described as
follows. There are no water molecules in `vacuum.pdb` and `vacuum.psf`.
In run_min.inp, `run_eq[1-3].inp`, and `run_fep[1-2].inp`, vacuum option
is set to "YES". CUTOFF is used for energy evaluation instead of PME.
The cutoff distance should be set to a sufficiently large value (here we
use 300Å). The box size should be consistent with the large pairlist
distance. Also, NVT should be used in order to fix the simulation box
size. If NPT is used in a vacuum simulation, the box size shrinks
drastically, which can lead to an early termination of the simulation.


```toml
[ENERGY]
forcefield       = CHARMM       # [CHARMM]
electrostatic    = CUTOFF       # [CUTOFF,PME]
switchdist       = 298.0        # switch distance
cutoffdist       = 300.0        # cutoff distance
pairlistdist     = 305.0        # pair-list distance
vdw_force_switch = YES
vacuum           = YES

[BOUNDARY]
type            = PBC           # [PBC]
box_size_x      = 921
box_size_y      = 921
box_size_z      = 921
```

Similarly to FEP simulations in solvent, after performing minimization,
equilibration, and FEP/\\(\\lambda\\)REMD simulations, we can obtain
\\(\\Delta G\_{mut}\^{vacuum}\\) by executing `post_run.sh`.

 

## 5. Calculation of \\(\\Delta \\Delta G\_{solv} \\) and comparison with the experimental value

Figure 10 shows the free-energy changes from the initial state (methane)
to the final state (methanol). The free-energy change in window ID 12
for "in solvent" and "in vacuum" corresponds to \\(\\Delta
G\_{mut}\^{solvent} \\) and \\(\\Delta G\_{mut}\^{vacuum} \\),
respectively. From our calculations, we obtained \\(\\Delta
G\_{mut}\^{solvent} = 8.52±0.01 \\) kcal/mol and \\(\\Delta
G\_{mut}\^{vacuum} = 15.35±0.00 \\) kcal/mol. Therefore, the relative
solvation free energy is \\(\\Delta \\Delta G\_{solv} = −6.83±0.01 \\)
kcal/mol, which is in good agreement with the experimental value (-7.10
kcal/mol [^9]).

for "in solvent" and "in vacuum".

 

## 6. (Optional) Embarrassingly parallel computing

FEP/\\(\\lambda\\)REMD requires large computational resources at one
time, because MD simulations for all \\(\\lambda\\) windows must be
performed simultaneously in order to be exchanged periodically. 
However, if replica-exchange is not used, \\(\\lambda\\) windows are
independent from each other, and simulations for different
\\(\\lambda\\) values can be performed separately. This parallelization
scheme is called "embarrassingly parallel" (also called "bakapara" in
Japanese). To generate input files for embarrassingly parallel FEP
simulations, comment out `md_type=remd` and uncomment
`md_type=distributed` in make_inp.sh.


```bash
# set md type (remd or distributed)
#md_type=remd
md_type=distributed
```

make_inp.sh generates 60 input files (`run1_rep1.inp` to
`run1_rep12.inp`, `run2_rep1.inp` to `run2_rep12.inp`, ...).
`run1_rep1.inp` is an input file for performing a 1-ns FEP simulation
for window ID 1 only. A section of the run1_rep1.inp file is shown
below. In this input file, \[REMD\] section is removed. `fep_md_type`
and `ref_lambid` are added in \[ALCHEMY\] section. When `fep_md_type` is
set to Single, the simulation uses only one lambda window and becomes
embarrassingly parallel. `ref_lambid` specifies the lambda windows used
for the simulation.


```toml
[ALCHEMY]
fep_direction = BothSides
fep_topology = hybrid
fep_md_type = Single
ref_lambid = 1
singleA = 1
singleB = 2
dualA = 3
dualB = 4
...
```

MD simulations for different replicas ` run1_rep1.inp` to
`run1_rep12.inp` can be executed independently. Input files for
different run numbers (i.e., `run2_rep*.inp, run3_rep*.inp, …`) are
executed sequentially to obtain a 5-ns simulation in
total.

In embarrassingly parallel computation, there is no need to sort the
fepfile file using `remd_convert`. To obtain the free-energy difference,
comment out `md_type=remd` and uncomment `md_type=distributed` in
`post_run.sh` to avoid sorting and to concatenate fepfile obtained by
FEP simulations, respectively.
